## 1. Project Description
DealFlowLifecyclev1 (DFL) is an end-to-end investment deal lifecycle management platform.  
It empowers funds, family offices, and venture firms to track, collaborate on, and execute deals—from initial sourcing through closing and post-investment monitoring—while maintaining a single source of truth for documents, capital calls, analytics, and stakeholder communications.

- **Shared:** Zod schemas, universal path resolver, shared utils  
- **Tooling:** Jest/Vitest, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions CI

## 4. Architecture Overview
```
monorepo/
├── client      # React SPA
├── server      # Express API & jobs
├── shared      # Isomorphic models/utilities
└── scripts     # DB and storage migrations
```
The server follows a service-oriented pattern: each bounded context (deals, documents, capital calls, etc.) exposes a controller, service, and route module. Communication with async background jobs (notifications, reports) is abstracted via `JobQueue`.
